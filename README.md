![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-Raft%20Algorithm-orange.svg?style=flat-square)  
A local running, distributed KV store for learning purposes based on replica state machine(RSM) cluster which implements raft consensus algorithm in a fully asynchronous way.
### Introduction
#### Implementation
Using netty's event-driven udp for async communication among nodes inside the cluster.
