A local, micro & distributed replica state machine(RSM) cluster **for learning** which implements *raft consensus algorithm* in a fully asynchronous way and does simple log replication.
### Introduction
Using netty's event-driven udp for communication.

### Progress
#### Finished
- Basic leader election/reelection
#### Ongoing
- Log replication
- Client interaction
#### Todo
- Safety
- Persisted states & recovery
- Leadership transfer extension
- Cluster membership changes
- Log compaction
- Lock free
